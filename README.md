# Blog API

This repo is specifically for the REST API of the Blog-API project. The API itself has the ability to create posts and comments as well as editing them. Authentication also exists to make sure only registered users are able to create and publish posts. The rest of the project consists of a CMS for the blog data as well as a client-side frontend.
